In this project I solved a challenge consisting in making a responsive web page testing my skills in HTML/CSS. The page shows a creative team's presentation webpage, showing its members, roles and a picture of each one. 
It was my first atempt to do a web page and I really enjoyed the process. With it I really managed to understand the foundaments of flex tool and responsive design, what I think will be really useful in my frontend skills.
